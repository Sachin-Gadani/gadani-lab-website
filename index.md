# Translational Neuroimmunology lab @ Pitt
While there are several effective treatments for relapsing multiple sclerosis, no available therapy substantially slows progression. Chronic, non-resolving brain and glial cell inflammation underlies this progression. Our goal is to unravel the neuroimmunology of progressive multiple sclerosis and other conditions to inspire the next generation of therapies.
