Sachin is a clinician scientist and neuroimmunologist interested in multiple sclerosis, immune-glia interactions, and meningeal immunity. He did MD/PhD at the University of Virginia with Dr. Jony Kipnis studying IL-33 in spinal cord injury. He then went to the Johns Hopkins Hospital for Neurology residency and neuroimmunology fellowship, where he studied multiple sclerosis with Dr. Peter Calabresi. In addition to research, he sees patients in the UPMC multiple sclerosis center and attends on the inpatient neurology servies. Outside of lab you can usually find him chasing after his toddler through Schenley park.
